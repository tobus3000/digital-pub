## Requirements

This is using the `openai` library, so you'll either need a subscription there or you install something like LM Studio locally..

* [LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai/)
  - Download a model. I use: `TheBloke - Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2-GGUF - mistral-7b-instruct-v0.2.Q3_K_M`
  - Run server in LM Studio. This exposes a local endpoint that uses port `1234` by default.
